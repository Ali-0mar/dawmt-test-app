- Overview of Implementation
Pagination and Searching: The API provided does not support pagination or searching by title. Although I implemented a method for data pagination, it couldn't be used due to the API's limitations. Similarly, searching by title is conducted on the frontend only, as the API only supports searching by category.

Error Handling: Due to time constraints, the error handling is basic. It's something I acknowledge and would improve given more time.

Styling Considerations: While I'm proficient in writing CSS, I must admit that I struggle with inventing styles from scratch. In the absence of a design file (e.g., XD or Figma), making a prototype becomes challenging and I didn't use any styling library since the implementation is simple and doesn't involve a lot of components.

Areas for Improvement
Pagination: Given more time and a backend that supports it, I would implement a proper pagination solution.

Error Handling: Improving error handling to provide better user feedback and handling edge cases.

Design: With access to design files, I'd create a more visually appealing and cohesive UI/UX.

Conclusion
Thank you for reviewing my submission. I'm open to feedback and suggestions for improving this application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss it further.
